# OBLOKOS — CLOSING STATEMENT (Closed Cycle / As-Built)

This document declares the closure of the current Oblokos cycle.

## Status:

- The Oblokos ERC-721 contract (Polygon) is active as the canonical proof of ownership.
- Metadata and art assets have been migrated to Arweave as a resolvable bundle with a root transaction.
- Root 1 is considered the stable, final infrastructure state for this cycle.

## Canonical anchors:

- Contract (Polygon): 0x252f9390feb63aeb00042dd5c4ff84af33f42b85    
- Root 1 (Arweave): PCx7dfAg6p2cN8y5FbrZaLuYvS5o7ecyVi821yyLoPg
- Public index: https://arweave.net/PCx7dfAg6p2cN8y5FbrZaLuYvS5o7ecyVi821yyLoPg/

## Governance (post-decentralization):

- No arbitrary modifications of metadata, images, or attributes.
- No retroactive rewriting of the system’s historical layer.
- Any future evolution will occur via new cycles (new contracts / new roots), not by altering this closed cycle.

## Installations:
Assemblies (installations) may be built from subsets of the existing fragments. An installation is a derived work, not the system itself. Platform-specific exhibitions may change over time, but the core remains verifiable through the anchors above.

This cycle is closed. The system is finite. The archive is permanent.
