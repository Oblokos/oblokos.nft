# OBLOKOS \- Whitepaper v2.0 (EN)

Fragmented digital sculptural system through NFTs (OBLK / ERC-721 on Polygon) with permanent infrastructure on Arweave. "Final Design / As-Built" edition (post-decentralization).

---

## 0\. Canonical identifiers (public anchors of the system)

* Contract (Polygon / ERC-721): 0x252f9390feb63aeb00042dd5c4ff84af33f42b85  
* Root 1 (Arweave / NFT system infrastructure): PCx7dfAg6p2cN8y5FbrZaLuYvS5o7ecyVi821yyLoPg

These two identifiers are sufficient to verify and reconstruct the Oblokos core system without relying on exhibition platforms.

## 1\. Abstract

Oblokos is a digital sculptural system built through fragmented NFTs. Each token represents a structural and conceptual fragment of a larger system. When fragments are spatially assembled, they form immersive digital sculptures that enable narrative and conceptual exploration.

The ownership model is fragmented:

* Owning some fragments implies partial (structural/conceptual) ownership of a possible assembly.  
* Owning all fragments defined for a given assembly implies full ownership of that assembled work.

The project is supported by two layers:

* Polygon (on-chain): proof of ownership.  
* Arweave (permaweb): permanent archive of metadata, art, and viewer.

No artificial utility is attached. No financial promises are made. Ownership is structural and conceptual.

---

## 2\. Conceptual framework

Oblokos explores the relationship between:

* System errors (failure as artifact, not decoration)  
* Digital identity (as a system, not only as a brand)  
* Fragmentation (as a structure for authorship and ownership)  
* Spatial reconstruction (as a sculptural act)

Across multiple collections, each NFT represents a real computer error code: a symbolic failure event derived from computing systems. These codes do not function as "traits"; they operate as conceptual material translated into visual structure.

---

## 3\. Core rule v2.0: Fragments and layers

Oblokos is defined by an internal rule that structures both the documentation and the curatorial discourse:

### 3.1 Fragments

* A fragment is an NFT (ERC-721) that functions as the minimal unit of the distributed sculpture.

### 3.2 Layers

Components are not interpreted only as parts; they are also layers that overlap:

* Architectural  
* Energetic  
* Ecological  
* Narrative  
* Glitch (perceptual / constructive)  
* Blockchain (ownership / traceability)

Reading the work as layers is part of the system design, not an optional "style".

---

## 4\. Fragmented ownership model

Let an assembly (S) be composed of fragments (F1, F2, ..., Fn). Each Fi is an ERC-721 token.

Rules:

* Some fragments \-\> partial (structural/conceptual) ownership of the assembly.  
* All fragments \-\> full ownership of the assembly.

Important:

* Ownership is not defined as "access" or "benefit".  
* It is defined as a structural relationship between fragments and the legitimate possibility of assembly.

---

## 5\. Base infrastructure: Polygon \+ Arweave

### 5.1 Polygon: ownership and traceability

* The OBLK contract (ERC-721) lives on Polygon and defines on-chain ownership.  
* The system supply is finite (closed cycle, no new emissions).

### 5.2 Arweave: operational permanence

System decentralization is completed by publishing on Arweave a bundle with a manifest (resolvable structure) anchored at:

* Root 1: PCx7dfAg6p2cN8y5FbrZaLuYvS5o7ecyVi821yyLoPg

Root 1 is infrastructure for the NFT system (it is not an installation nor "the total work"). It contains:

* index.html (viewer)  
* /metadata (JSON)  
* /art (renders)  
* resolvable manifest

The permaweb preserves the system in a stable way: even if external services or repositories change, the core remains verifiable.

---

## 6\. Metadata structure (and why it matters)

Each token metadata follows a consistent structure, with fields such as:

* id  
* name (error / piece identifier)  
* description (conceptual/technical explanation)  
* image (permanent render)  
* external\_url (permanent viewer)  
* attributes (structural parameters and traceability)

### 6.1 Generative attributes as structure (not cosmetic)

Certain attributes document how the image was constructed:

* frame \-\> internal render reference  
* index \-\> normalized generation index  
* level \-\> hierarchical/compositional depth

These are not "rare traits"; they are a record of construction logic.

---

## 7\. Governance and stability (post-closure)

The system clearly distinguishes:

* Artist account (authorship): identity declared in metadata.  
* Technical account (operational authority): exists only for historical maintenance and system closure.

### 7.1 Post-decentralization principle

Once migrated to Arweave:

* Infrastructure is considered stable.  
* No changes are made that harm holders.  
* The past is not "rewritten" to modify the work.

### 7.2 Closed system per cycle

Current collections constitute a finite system. If new rules are required, a new cycle is opened (new contract / new infrastructure), avoiding changes to the historical layer.

---

## 8\. Assemblies and installations (independent of the system)

This whitepaper defines a crucial point:

An installation is an assembly derived from the system, not the system.

* An assembly consumes a subset of NFTs as sculptural material.  
* It can exist in virtual, physical, or hybrid spaces.  
* It may depend on platforms (site-specific), but the Oblokos system does not depend on their continuity.

Full decentralization does not require that all 3D experiences live outside platforms; it requires that:

* proof of ownership is on-chain, and  
* documentation and structure are permanent and verifiable.

---

## 9\. Assembly sales model (when applicable)

When an assembly is commercialized as a work:

* The experience/assembly is sold together with its concept and documentation.  
* The sale includes the transfer of the set of NFTs used (structural base and proof of ownership of the assembly).

### 9.1 Authorized edition exclusivity

Exclusivity is defined as:

* Single authorized edition: the artist does not reinstall that configuration for third parties (not even for free).

Clarification:

* Exclusivity does not mean "technical impossibility of copying".  
* It means legitimacy: a single authorized right of exploitation for the buyer.

### 9.2 Logical restriction due to third-party NFTs

An assembly cannot be sold as a complete package if it includes NFTs the artist no longer owns, unless there is an explicit agreement between parties. This reinforces the real structural scarcity of the fragmented model.

---

## 10\. Permanent public registry (Installation Registry Record)

So that the history of editions/assemblies does not depend on platforms, the system includes a permanent mechanism:

Installation Registry Record (IRR) published on Arweave for each authorized/sold assembly, including:

* Title  
* Date and context  
* Exact list of token IDs used  
* Links to documentation (dossier, credits, images/video)  
* Status (e.g., Authorized / Sold)  
* Optional: owner wallet

This creates verifiable historical traceability and proof of authorized uniqueness.

---

## 11\. Sovereign identity and "roots" architecture

Oblokos is assumed as a sovereign artistic identity with three pillars:

1\. Institutional domain (oblokos.nft) as a verifiable entry point

2\. Root 1 as permanent infrastructure of the NFT system

3\. Root 2 as a minimal institutional archive (Artist Site / Archive) published on Arweave and referenced from the domain, containing:

* short manifesto,  
* contract \+ Root 1,  
* whitepaper and curatorial documents,  
* index of IRRs,  
* institutional contact.

Root 2 is not an "exhibition space"; it is a sovereign index.

---

## 12\. Final statement

Oblokos proposes a structural shift:

* from collectible images \-\> to distributed sculpture  
* from isolated tokens \-\> to layer-based assemblies  
* from platform dependence \-\> to verifiable permanent infrastructure  
* from "failure" as error \-\> to failure as sculptural material

Each fragment is a failure event translated into form. Together, the fragments define a system.

And the system is publicly anchored by:

* Contract: 0x252f9390feb63aeb00042dd5c4ff84af33f42b85  
* Root 1: PCx7dfAg6p2cN8y5FbrZaLuYvS5o7ecyVi821yyLoPg
