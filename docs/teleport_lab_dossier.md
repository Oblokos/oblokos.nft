## Executive summary

Teleport Lab is a sci-fi metaverse art installation conceived as a **site-specific digital sculpture**: a laboratory of interconnected portals that transforms space through layers (architecture, energy, ecosystems, glitch, and data). The work reveals itself through movement: the experience changes according to angle and route, making perception part of the assembly.

Teleport Lab integrates the **Oblokos (OBLK)** system: an ERC-721 collection on Polygon where each NFT represents a computational error translated into a visual fragment. In the installation, these fragments operate as **structural matter** - not as framed pictures - and are assembled into portals and energetic surfaces.

The project has a full inventory of assets and licenses (including CC-BY models from Sketchfab) and credits documentation ready for curatorial audit.

---

## Artist Statement

Teleport Lab approaches portals as **operating systems**: thresholds that consume, alter, and leave traces in their environment. Rather than representing first contact as a linear narrative, it embodies it as incompatibility between technological languages: what appears to be failure is incomplete translation between layers.

Glitch is not an effect applied afterward. It is a **constructive condition**: perceptual friction that makes visible the seam between the human and the non-human, between protocols that never fully align.

---

## Recognition and context

Teleport Lab was developed within the **Sketch Your Space Design Challenge (Spatial x Sketchfab)**, associated with the direct 3D model import integration from Sketchfab into Spatial.

## Conceptual framework

Teleport Lab is framed in Oblokos as a **fragmented digital sculptural system**. The core rule is dual: each NFT is a **fragment** (minimum unit), and at the same time the components are read as **overlapping layers** - architectural, energetic, ecological, narrative, glitch, and blockchain - that coexist in the same assembly.

System errors do not operate as decoration: they are conceptual artifacts. In Oblokos, failure is incorporated as material to construct form, energy, and perceptual reading. The visitor does not observe a fixed image: they interact with a structure that reorganizes according to their position.

### Glitch as sculptural language

In real-time rendering engines, certain failures appear due to depth and transparency ordering. In Teleport Lab these phenomena are used as sculptural mechanics:

- **a)** depth conflict (**z-fighting**) for energetic vibration
- **b)** imperfect transparency ordering for fragmentary reveal
- **c)** dynamic **flicker** for a perceptual electric field

## Welcome to the Holodeck

**Entry installation - system layer**

"Welcome to the Holodeck" receives the visitor at the exact materialization point. The user does not enter by walking: they appear on a circular device that functions as a technical portal and states, from the first second, that Teleport Lab is a system and not a neutral "lobby."

The scene combines identity and orientation: the Oblokos 3D logo in the background, a holodeck-style image (programmable grid), and vertical light columns crossing the space. The main image is intentionally duplicated, producing a slight flicker: it is not an error, it is a first signal of controlled instability.

From this threshold, the route is anticipated. The architecture leads toward the wing where the Rio Grande Portal is located, and biological presence associated with the Sena Portal is already perceived (jellyfish visible at a distance). The entrance, by design, is already active: it integrates the narrative and prepares the visitor for an experience understood through movement.

**Keywords:** arrival portal, threshold, identity, system, controlled instability

## Rio Grande Portal

**Convergence and transit installation - convergence layer**

Rio Grande Portal concentrates all its force in a single point: a gravitational center that suggests crossing rather than "decoration." The piece is presented in the Agora environment (Spatial) - a gallery with neutral lighting and institutional language - to emphasize the contrast between museological control and unstable phenomenon. The area is identified with a red "Rio Grande Portal" label.

The configuration integrates a sci-fi corridor with glass walls acting as a showcase: the space is reprogrammed as containment infrastructure. Behind the glass, samples of the NFTs used appear (with labels and traceability links), exhibited as a visible archive of the matter composing the portal.

The core does not "contain" NFTs: it is made of NFTs. Tokenized translucent sheets overlap and intersect at the center, building a changing volume perceived differently according to angle and proximity. Glitch - flicker, depth conflicts, and transparencies that order themselves imperfectly - functions as a radiation trace: it affects both the environment (walls/glass) and the portal body, reinforcing the sensation of an active system.

Rio Grande also operates as navigation infrastructure: it integrates a teleport link inside Spatial, executing transit (not only evoking it). As portable record, the installation includes an anchor image with access to external documentation and a dedicated sculpture viewer.

## Orinoco Portal

**Active ecosystem installation - ecological layer + NFT layer**

Orinoco Portal is an ecosystem system inside Teleport Lab, presented as active phenomenon and layered sculptural assembly. Its setup occupies an exhibition zone of the Agora template (Spatial): gallery architecture with neutral lighting and walls prepared to "hang" works. In that institutional context, the portal breaks in as an event that affects the building.

The immediate exterior behaves like an alien garden: vegetation distributed mostly outside the path (perimeter garden), plants with their own substrate, and others growing in the air, floating above cracks and grass. Some species read as carnivorous: victim bones appear - including human remains - as a sign of real biological risk within the fiction.

The zone is marked with a blue "Orinoco Portal" label and warning signage (biological risk, radiation, laser damage, and impact). This institutional layer does not explain the portal: it formalizes it as an observed, dangerous, and partially controlled phenomenon.

A distinctive feature is the relation to architectural matter: the portal absorbs bricks from the wall, which reappear inside as evidence of origin. On the output side, bricks of different composition float toward the garden as an image of suspended material transit.

In parallel with the immersive phenomenon, Orinoco exposes its fragmentary layer: on a nearby wall, the NFTs used are presented, with labels and public access links, acting as a verifiable archive of the assembly. Glitch is integrated as behavior - variable reading by angle, competition between layers, and fragmentary reveal - coherent with Oblokos as a system.

The installation also includes an anchor image that links to an external viewer to see the portal sculpture in isolation, as portable documentation of the assembly.

**Keywords:** biosphere, alien garden, institutional risk, bricks in transit, NFTs as structure, constructive glitch

## Biome Orinoco

**Contained ecosystem installation - scientific layer**

Biome Orinoco is an encapsulated ecosystem located in the transition between Gallery and Auditorium. It does not function as a decorative garden: it is presented as a stabilized specimen, a "scientific" pause inside the lab.

The scene is organized as a vegetal diorama (3D models with open licenses, credited in the inventory) integrated into architecture through stepped distribution. A continuous containment frame with magenta luminescence and an internal hexagonal grid construct the idea of an active technological field (not glass), reinforced by overlapping transparencies that simulate documentation layers.

A vertical panel in botanical-sheet style introduces an archive reading: diagram, annotation, and growth stages. The visitor moves from the immersive portal experience toward an institutional presentation of the ecosystem as an object of study.

The vegetal models are kept without structural alteration to preserve authorship and traceability; the containment system and graphic layers belong to the Oblokos environment.

**Keywords:** containment, archive, specimen, hexagonal grid, institutional pause, traceability

## Sena Portal

**Electric-drift and biological-transit installation - transit layer**

Sena Portal is the only portal located outside the main route: exposed, without clinical containment or neutral lighting, it functions as transition between Rio Grande and the Lounge. The exterior condition is not scenography: it is part of node behavior. The environment sustains an ecosystem of giant alien jellyfish, emphasizing biological presence and aesthetic scale.

The piece is organized as a double-vortex system connected by a beam, with a central gravitational core:

- **Two operable vortices (entry/exit):** each end integrates 3D models as part of the mechanism; bubbles emerge from them as a signal of pressure or discharge.
- **Gravitational core:** at the center, two 3D models intersect; the core is perceived as a zone of spatial conflict where the beam becomes mass.
- **The beam as body:** the beam is formed by assembled Oblokos NFTs as an energy conductor and evidence of the phenomenon. It presents dense stretches (layer overlap) and a deliberately minimal stretch - a dotted line built by successive frames - to allow route passage without shutting down the event.
- **NFT oval + jellyfish in transit:** in one section an NFT ring/oval appears; at its center, a distorted and stretched jellyfish is shown explicitly in transit inside the beam, deformed by the field.

In Sena, glitch functions as perceptual electrical discharge: edge vibration, interference, and incomplete readings due to competition between layers and transparencies. The piece sustains a double reading: phenomenon + archive. Near the portal there are samples of the NFTs used and an anchor image linking to external documentation with a dedicated viewer.

**External documentation (sculpture viewer):**

**Keywords:** exterior, double vortex, tokenized beam, jellyfish in transit, gravitational core, electric glitch

## Sunset Window

**Luminous transition installation - atmospheric threshold**

Sunset Window introduces a register change inside the lab: it is not a technical portal but a perceptual threshold. The installation proposes the sensation of physically entering an abstract sunset: the sunset is not observed, it is inhabited.

The area is wrapped by a tube with reflective surface and sky-blue patterns. Radial sky-blue lines cross a volume saturated in reds and magentas and converge toward an endpoint where a backlit tree silhouette appears. The device functions as an optical tunnel: it removes architectural edges, compresses visual direction, and pushes the visitor toward the background.

Within the Teleport Lab system, the piece acts as emotional pause and sensory absorption. It contrasts with the dominant rupture-and-glitch logic of the portals, and reintroduces chromatic and directional experience as part of the route.

**Keywords:** perceptual threshold, reflective tunnel, pictorial immersion, visual direction, pause

---

## Technical architecture and operation

Teleport Lab is built on a **"base architecture + sculptural composition"** model. The base architecture comes from Spatial's Agora template, and the work is organized as overlapping layers within that environment.

In Spatial, a template functions as a space snapshot: it preserves environment and content positions. This enables repeatable deployments (for example, reinstallation or operational transfer), using temporary edit permissions during setup.

Performance decisions: VR stability is prioritized. Examples: removal of specular surfaces in Rio Grande and simplification of the Orinoco core to eliminate lag, without losing conceptual density.

### External documentation (3D viewer) and preservation

In addition to the Spatial space (site-specific work), Teleport Lab has external platform-independent documentation:

- **Full Teleport Lab viewer (assets + transforms):**  
  https://oblokos.github.io/teleport-lab/  
  This 3D viewer loads **each image, NFT, and 3D model** incorporated in Teleport Lab with its **position, rotation, and scale**, as a verifiable setup record. It does not recreate Spatial's model/atmosphere (Agora): it focuses on artist-provided assets to document the full work.

- **Public repository (documentation source):**  
  https://github.com/Oblokos/teleport-lab  
  Documentation is hosted as the repository's GitHub Pages site.

- **Per-sculpture viewers (isolated portal + grid):**
  - https://oblokos.github.io/teleport-lab/sculptures/?sculpture=SENA_PORTAL
  - https://oblokos.github.io/teleport-lab/sculptures/?sculpture=RIO_GRANDE_PORTAL
  - https://oblokos.github.io/teleport-lab/sculptures/?sculpture=ORINOCO_PORTAL

  Each page allows exploring only the selected sculpture in a 3D viewer, and consulting the **informational NFT grid** used in that piece.

### Site-specific dependency

Teleport Lab is a site-specific work: it exists inside Spatial infrastructure (navigation, real-time rendering, social logic, and template system). For this reason, a minimal documentary preservation policy is recommended: screenshots, video walkthrough, asset inventory, and master template backup.

---

## Provenance, blockchain, and decentralization

The Oblokos (OBLK) system operates as an on-chain ownership and traceability layer: ERC-721 tokens on Polygon. In Teleport Lab, NFT fragments can act as structural matter (for example, in Orinoco's energetic core).

The NFT system infrastructure was migrated to Arweave as a bundle with resolvable manifest (Root 1). The root_txid and Polygon contract operate as canonical anchors to verify and reconstruct the system core without depending on centralized repositories.

## Ownership, transfer, and acquisition models

**Recommended model:** _Complete Sculptural Transfer Model._

The package includes:

1. operational Teleport Lab deployment in Spatial via template/overlay,
2. transfer of associated NFTs as structural base and on-chain ownership proof, and
3. conceptual, technical, and credits documentation.

### Operational deployment protocol

- Meeting in the buyer's space (Spatial).
- The buyer grants temporary edit permissions ("Can Edit") for setup.
- The artist deploys the master template (overlay) and verifies: layout, assets, media, texts.
- Transfer of the NFT constellation to the buyer's wallet (Polygon).
- Permissions returned to restrictive mode ("View Only") for public operation.

### NFT transfer options (summary)

- **Option A (default):** direct transfer to buyer's personal wallet.
- **Option B (institutional):** dedicated wallet for the work (separates patrimonial custody).
- **Option C (exceptional):** temporary escrow/custody for high-value sales and milestone validation.

### Maintenance clause (without legal advice)

The work is delivered and verified as operational at deployment time. Subsequent modifications by buyer or third parties are outside the artist's maintenance scope.

Restoration or reinstallation services can be agreed by commission and availability.
