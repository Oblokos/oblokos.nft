## Executive summary

Teleport Lab is a sci-fi metaverse art installation designed as a site-specific digital sculpture: a laboratory of interconnected portals that transforms space through layered systems (architecture, energy, ecosystems, glitch, and data).

Teleport Lab integrates the **Oblokos (OBLK)** ERC-721 system on Polygon, where each NFT represents a computational error translated into a visual fragment. In the installation these fragments operate as structural matter.

---

## Artist statement

Teleport Lab approaches portals as operating systems: thresholds that consume, alter, and leave traces in their environment. Glitch is not post-production decoration. It is a constructive condition that reveals seams between human and non-human protocols.

---

## Recognition and context

Teleport Lab was developed in the context of the **Sketch Your Space Design Challenge (Spatial x Sketchfab)**.

Recognition: Tier 1 winner.

---

## Conceptual framework

Teleport Lab follows the Oblokos rule: each NFT is a fragment (minimum unit), and each component is also read as a layer (architectural, energetic, ecological, narrative, glitch, and blockchain).

### Glitch as sculptural language

Real-time rendering artifacts are used as sculptural mechanics:

- depth conflict (**z-fighting**) for energetic vibration
- imperfect transparency ordering for fragmentary reveal
- dynamic **flicker** for perceptual electric field

---

## Technical architecture and operation

Teleport Lab follows a "base architecture + sculptural composition" model over the Spatial Agora template.

Performance decisions prioritize VR stability (for example: reducing reflective surfaces and simplifying heavy cores while preserving conceptual density).
