# MANIFESTO - OBLOKOS (Artist Identity / System)

Oblokos is a finite sculptural system built from fragmented NFTs.

Each token (OBLK / ERC-721 on Polygon) is not an isolated collectible: it is a structural fragment of a larger work. When fragments are assembled in space, they form installations made of layers: architectural, energetic, ecological, perceptual (glitch), narrative, and blockchain provenance.

Computer errors are treated as artifacts, not defects. Glitch is not decoration: it is a constructive condition.

This cycle is closed.

The core infrastructure is permanently anchored:

Contract (Polygon / ERC-721): 0x252f9390feb63aeb00042dd5c4ff84af33f42b85

Root 1 (Arweave / NFT infrastructure): PCx7dfAg6p2cN8y5FbrZaLuYvS5o7ecyVi821yyLoPg

Root 1 contains the viewer, metadata, and art renders as a resolvable manifest bundle. From this point forward, the system does not depend on centralized hosting.

Teleport Lab is an installation derived from the system (site-specific in Spatial). Its documentation can be preserved, but the system itself remains verifiable via the contract + Arweave roots.

Oblokos exists as an artist identity anchored in permanent infrastructure.

Fully decentralized core: on-chain ownership + permanent permaweb archive.
